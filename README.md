Expose Questions:

1) I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because there's a lot of components to writing and sending a message to another user so I think it wouldn't be accurate.
2) I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" because that's a small scale issue that can be tested easily with a unit test since it's not reliant on other features.
